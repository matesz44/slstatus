slstatus - suckless status
==========================
slstatus is a suckless status monitor for window managers that use WM_NAME
(e.g. dwm) or stdin to fill the status bar.


Features
--------
- CPU usage
- CPU frequency
- Custom shell commands
- Date and time
- Disk status (free storage, percentage, total storage and used storage)
- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)

Requirements
------------
Currently slstatus works on FreeBSD, Linux and OpenBSD.
In order to build slstatus you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slstatus is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slstatus (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slstatus
----------------
See the man page for details.


Configuration
-------------
slstatus can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.


Todo
----
Cleaning up the whole codebase it the goal before thinking about a release.
